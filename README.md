This is a log of small, self-contained AI security experiments that can be run on a laptop.

I'm Lily Sijia Li, a CISSP-certified cybersecurity professional with years of experience at Cisco helping companies improve their security posture. Later at Microsoft, I focused on securing cloud-based AI workloads for global financial institutions. Now, I've returned to academia and research emerging AI threats at the University of Oxford.

This blog, **`lab notes`**, is where I publish small hobby research projects and experiments especially around:
- Different attacks on models (e.g., backdoor, poisoning)
- Supply chain attacks on models  
- Adversarial robustness  

I hope that by sharing my notes, I can make AI security research more accessible to those outside academia.
