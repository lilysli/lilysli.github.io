Hi, I’m Lily 👋

I’m a **Cybersecurity student at the University of Oxford**, with prior experience at **Cisco** and **Microsoft**. My research sits at the intersection of **AI and security**, exploring how machine learning systems can be better protected against attacks.

This blog, **`lab`**, is where I publish **small hobby research projects and experiments**, especially around:
- Different attacks on models (e.g. backdoor, poisoning)
- Supply chain attacks on models  
- Adversarial robustness  

Think of it as a public lab notebook: Just curiosity, code, and occasional dead ends.  

Everything here is **work in progress**. Feedback, corrections, and reading recommendations are welcome!
